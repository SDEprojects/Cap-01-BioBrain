                 In a post-apocalyptic world, Earth has become uninhabitable and shelters in space have
             become colonies for which humans have continued their survival. However, several colonies have
                  formed into a new and rebellious republic of their own and a civil war has ensued.

               The colonies most highly skilled mercenary Jung E, died as a hero in an attempt to defeat
           the newly formed republic. However, a government AI research lab devised a plan to create a replica
           of the famed mercenary via the BioBrain...a high-tech identical replication of the human brain and
           with an identical face and body. Memory, emotion, and skill set have been extracted as data
                        specifically from the heroic soldier in their final moments before death.

                      You are Dr. X, the lead scientist of the BioBrain project chosen as lead due
                  to a very special connection you share with the BioBrain Combat AI...that mercenary
                     was your mother who had previously joined the war when you were just a child.

             The government recently decided that due to multiple failed simulations over the years they are
               shutting down the project and heading in a different direction. Earlier today however, when
                running your usual simulations you learned that a new part of the AI's brain could be activated
                in a way that make the AI aware of itself, essentially giving it a life and autonomy again.
                     Secretly you enhanced the AI, and told them everything that had been done.

                        You are going to help your mother escape...the only thing is how?
